# Data Augmentation for Images

Overview
- Demonstrates common image augmentation techniques to improve generalization.
- Uses Keras `ImageDataGenerator` / `tf.image` on the flower_photos dataset.

What It Does
- Visualizes augmented samples and compares training with vs. without augmentation.
- Tracks effects on accuracy and overfitting.

Run
- Place dataset under `data/` (if not included) and run the notebook in JupyterLab.
