# Customer Churn Prediction (ANN)

Overview
- Predicts customer churn using a feed-forward neural network (TensorFlow/Keras).
- Demonstrates tabular preprocessing (encoding/scaling) and binary classification.

What It Does
- Loads the churn dataset, preprocesses features, trains an ANN, and evaluates with ROC‑AUC, PR‑AUC, and a confusion matrix.
- Saves learned artifacts to `models/` or `outputs/` (if configured).

Run
- Open the notebook and execute cells top‑to‑bottom; adjust hyperparameters as needed.
