# GPU Benchmarking

Overview
- Benchmarks TensorFlow training/inference on CPU vs. GPU for small CNN workloads.
- Helps quantify speedups and verify device placement.

What It Does
- Measures wall‑clock times/throughput for selected models, logs results, and visualizes them.

Run
- Ensure a GPU‑enabled TensorFlow install; run the notebooks and compare timings.
