# TensorBoard Tracking

Overview
- Uses TensorBoard to visualize training: scalars, histograms, images, and graphs.
- Demonstrates logging callbacks and how to compare runs.

What It Does
- Logs model training and provides instructions to launch TensorBoard for exploration.

Run
- Train a model with logging enabled, then run: `tensorboard --logdir runs/` (or the configured log dir).
