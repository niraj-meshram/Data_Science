# Dropout Regularization

Overview
- Shows how dropout reduces overfitting in neural networks.
- Compares baseline vs. dropout models on a small tabular/image task.

What It Does
- Trains models with and without dropout, tracks training/validation curves, and summarizes generalization differences.

Run
- Open the notebook and run cells; tweak dropout rates and layer placement.
