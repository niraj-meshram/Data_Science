# Gradient Descent (Neural Networks)

Overview
- Explores batch, stochastic, and mini‑batch gradient descent in the context of neural networks.
- Compares learning rates and optimizer choices on simple tasks.

What It Does
- Plots loss/metric curves and illustrates convergence behavior across settings.

Run
- Open the notebooks and execute; adjust learning rates and batch sizes to observe effects.
