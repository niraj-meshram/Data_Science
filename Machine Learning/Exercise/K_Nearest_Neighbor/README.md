# K‑Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Overview
- Instance-based learning that classifies/regresses based on nearest samples.
- Sensitive to feature scaling and the choice of K.

What It Does
- Applies KNN to digits/iris datasets and compares accuracy across K values and distance metrics.

Run
- Open the notebook and run; try different `n_neighbors` and `weights`.
