# Decision Tree

Overview
- Tree-based model for classification/regression with interpretable splits.
- Demonstrates depth control, impurity measures, and simple visualization.

What It Does
- Trains a DecisionTree on sample datasets and evaluates accuracy/MAE; explores overfitting vs. pruning.

Run
- Open the notebook and run cells; tweak `max_depth`, `min_samples_split`, etc.
