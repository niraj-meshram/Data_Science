# Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Overview
- Maximum-margin classifier/regressor with kernel tricks for non‑linear decision boundaries.

What It Does
- Trains linear/RBF SVMs on iris and other datasets; explores kernel parameters and regularization.

Run
- Open the notebook and execute; tune `C`, `gamma`, and kernel type.
